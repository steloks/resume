          <div class="mb-3">Some examples of <span class="clr-lbr">unusual behavior</span> are as follows. Your dog:<br>
            - Eats grass often and a lot;<br>
            - Itching too often;<br>
            - Eats furniture, shoes and other items at home and swallows them;<br>
            - Looks scared and hides;<br>
            - Any actions other than his usual behavior for the day;</div>
          <div>Our recommendation is to consult a veterinarian in any such case, because if, for example, you treat the dog's itching with shampoos and other medications or cosmetics for irritated skin, you may not achieve the effect, because often these itches are provoked by internal disorders and in particular, related to the liver.
